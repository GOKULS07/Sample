## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* MongoDB Atlas Account (Free tier is sufficient)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this entire project (which contains both frontend and backend folders) to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/GOKULS07/Room_Booker.git](https://github.com/GOKULS07/Room_Booker.git)
cd Room_Booker
2. Backend Setup
The backend handles the API and database interactions.

Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd guest-room-booking-backend
Install backend dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Set up Environment Variables (.env file):

Create a file named .env in the guest-room-booking-backend directory (next to package.json).

Add the following variables:

Code snippet

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_random_jwt_secret_here
BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL=[https://room-booker.onrender.com](https://room-booker.onrender.com)
MONGO_URI: Get this from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Remember to replace <username> and <password> with your database user's credentials. Example: mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

JWT_SECRET: Generate a long, random string. You can use node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))" in your terminal.

BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL: This is crucial for your images to load correctly on deployment. Set it to your Render service's public URL: https://room-booker.onrender.com.

Start the backend server:

Bash

npm start
You should see messages like "MongoDB Atlas Connected" and "Server running on port 5000".

3. Frontend Setup
The frontend is your React application.

Navigate to the frontend directory (in a new terminal tab/window):

Bash

cd ../guest-room-booking-frontend
(If you're already in the Room_Booker folder, you might need cd guest-room-booking-frontend directly).

Install frontend dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Configure Frontend Backend URL (.env.development for local, Vercel for deploy):

Important Code Change: In all your frontend files where you make axios calls (e.g., src/contexts/AuthContext.js, src/pages/RoomListPage.js, etc.), ensure http://localhost:5000 is replaced with ${process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL}. This is how your React app will dynamically know where to send requests.

For local development: If you want your local frontend to talk to your local backend, create a file named .env.development in your guest-room-booking-frontend directory.

Code snippet

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
(This file is typically ignored by Git, which is good. For deployment, Vercel will override this with its own environment variable).

Start the frontend development server:

Bash

npm start
Your application should open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
Ensure your backend server is running (from guest-room-booking-backend folder): npm start

Ensure your frontend development server is running (from guest-room-booking-frontend folder): npm start

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

üìÑ Database Schema
Your database design is based on the following Mongoose schemas:

1. User Collection (User.js)
Stores user authentication and role information.

Collection Name: users

- _id: ObjectId (Unique identifier, auto-generated)
- email: String (Unique, Required, Trimmed, Lowercase)
- password: String (Required, Hashed)
- mobileNumber: String (Unique, Required, Trimmed)
- role: String (Required, Enum: 'customer', 'house_owner')
- createdAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
- updatedAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
2. Room Collection (Room.js)
Stores details about each room listing.

Collection Name: rooms

- _id: ObjectId (Unique identifier, auto-generated)
- owner: ObjectId (Required, References 'User' collection - this is the house_owner)
- name: String (Required, Trimmed)
- floorSize: Number (Required)
- numberOfBeds: Number (Required)
- amenities: [String] (Array of strings, default: [])
- dailyRentAmount: Number (Required)
- minBookingDays: Number (Default: 1)
- maxBookingDays: Number (Default: 30)
- photos: [String] (Array of image URLs as strings, default: [])
- description: String (Trimmed, default: '')
- isAvailable: Boolean (Default: true)
- createdAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
- updatedAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
3. Booking Collection (Booking.js)
Stores information about each room booking.

Collection Name: bookings

- _id: ObjectId (Unique identifier, auto-generated)
- room: ObjectId (Required, References 'Room' collection)
- customer: ObjectId (Required, References 'User' collection - the customer who made the booking)
- owner: ObjectId (Required, References 'User' collection - the owner of the booked room)
- checkInDate: Date (Required)
- checkOutDate: Date (Required)
- totalPrice: Number (Required)
- status: String (Enum: 'pending', 'confirmed', 'completed', 'cancelled', default: 'pending')
- createdAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
- updatedAt: Date (Auto-generated timestamp)
üìä Sample Data
The easiest and most realistic way to get sample data into your database (and ensure correct linking between users, rooms, and bookings) is by using your application's own API endpoints after your backend server is running.

How to Generate Sample Data:
Ensure your backend server is running (npm start in guest-room-booking-backend).

Ensure your frontend server is running (npm start in guest-room-booking-frontend).

Register Users:

Go to http://localhost:3000/register.

Register a few house_owner users (e.g., owner1@example.com, owner2@example.com with unique mobile numbers and passwords).

Register a few customer users (e.g., customer1@example.com, customer2@example.com with unique mobile numbers and passwords).

Add Rooms:

Log in as one of your house_owner accounts (e.g., owner1@example.com).

Go to /owner/add-room.

Add several room listings, providing all details and uploading actual image files. This will populate your rooms collection.

Repeat with owner2@example.com to add more rooms.

Create Bookings:

Log in as one of your customer accounts (e.g., customer1@example.com).

Go to /rooms and browse the listings.

Click "View Details" on a room, then click "Book Now". Select dates and confirm the booking. This will populate your bookings collection.

Repeat with customer2@example.com to add more bookings.

To Extract Sample Data for Submission:
After generating data using the above method, you can connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster using MongoDB Compass:

Connect to your cluster using your MONGO_URI.

Go to the users, rooms, and bookings collections.

You can then use the "Export Collection" feature in Compass to save the data as .json files (e.g., sample_users.json, sample_rooms.json, sample_bookings.json).

These .json files will contain your actual ObjectIds and hashed passwords (for users), making them perfectly representative of your sample data.

üåê Deployment
This project uses Vercel for frontend hosting and Render for backend hosting.

1. Deploying the Frontend (Vercel)
Push Frontend Code to GitHub: Ensure your guest-room-booking-frontend directory is a separate GitHub repository (or part of a monorepo).

Connect Vercel:

Go to vercel.com and log in (e.g., with GitHub).

Click "Add New..." -> "Project".

"Import Git Repository" and select your frontend GitHub repository (e.g., Room_Booker if it's a monorepo).

Important: For "Root Directory", make sure it points to your frontend folder (e.g., guest-room-booking-frontend).

Vercel usually auto-detects "Create React App".

Set Environment Variable on Vercel:

After the initial deployment settings, go to your Vercel project's "Settings" tab -> "Environment Variables".

Add a new variable:

Name: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL

Value: https://room-booker.onrender.com (Your deployed Render backend URL)

Save this variable.

Trigger Redeployment: Go to "Deployments" and "Redeploy" the latest successful build, or push a small change to GitHub to trigger a new build. This ensures the frontend picks up the new backend URL.

2. Deploying the Backend (Render)
Push Backend Code to GitHub: Ensure your guest-room-booking-backend directory is in a GitHub repository.

Connect Render:

Go to render.com and log in (e.g., with GitHub).

Click "New" -> "Web Service".

"Connect Git Repository" and select your backend GitHub repository (e.g., Room_Booker if it's a monorepo).

Important: For "Root Directory", set it to your backend folder (e.g., guest-room-booking-backend).

Configure Build & Start Commands:

Name: room-booker-api (or your chosen name)

Region: Choose a region close to your MongoDB Atlas.

Runtime: Node.

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

Plan: Free.

Set Environment Variables on Render:

Before creating the service, go to "Advanced" (or after creation, in "Settings" -> "Environment Variables").

Add these variables:

MONGO_URI: Your full MongoDB Atlas connection string.

JWT_SECRET: The same strong secret you used in your backend's local .env file.

BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL: https://room-booker.onrender.com (This is critical for image URLs to be correctly stored in your database by your backend).

Save variables and click "Create Web Service".

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Troubleshooting
JWT Expired / 401 Unauthorized: If you get 401 Unauthorized errors after logging in, your JWT token might have expired (they last 1 hour) or your JWT_SECRET in .env might have changed. Clear your browser's Local Storage (F12 -> Application -> Local Storage -> Clear) and log in/register again.

Image Loading Issues (Mixed Content / ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED):

This often happens if room images were uploaded while your backend was running locally. The URLs in your database will be http://localhost:5000/uploads/....

Fix: Manually update these photos URLs in your MongoDB Atlas database to https://room-booker.onrender.com/uploads/.... Also, ensure your backend roomController.js is updated to store the BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL for new uploads.

"Module not found: axios" on Vercel: Ensure axios is listed in your guest-room-booking-frontend/package.json under dependencies.

"package.json not found" on Render: Double-check that you set the "Root Directory" in Render's web service settings to guest-room-booking-backend (or your actual backend folder name).

react-datepicker Warnings: Warnings about "Failed to parse source map" from react-datepicker are generally harmless and don't prevent your app from working. You can usually ignore them during development.
